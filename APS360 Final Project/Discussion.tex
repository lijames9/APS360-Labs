\section{Discussion: Deciphering Tweet Sentiments Through Deep Learning Insights}

%In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of our sentiment analysis project, highlighting the performance of our chosen Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the significance of our findings, and the insights gained from our journey. We also compare our CNN model's performance with the baseline LightGBM model, evaluate its generalization capabilities on the Dell-specific dataset, and conclude by underlining the project's educational and practical value.

\subsection{Model Performance and Interpretation}
\vspace{-1em}
Our CNN architecture exhibited exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.6\% on the training and validation datasets. This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy given the intricate nature of sentiment analysis. When extended to the Dell-specific dataset, our model demonstrated a 50\% accuracy, showcasing its adaptability to new data sources and its ability to generalize effectively.

The model's accuracy on the training, validation, and test datasets aligns consistently with our expectations. The confusion matrix on the validation data highlights the model's proficiency in classifying sentiment categories. These results reflect the successful navigation of sentiment analysis complexities.
